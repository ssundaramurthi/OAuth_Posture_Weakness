## Grant Types/Flows and Scopes
### Grant types

→ Determines the sequence of steps that's involved

→ Grant types/flows determine how the client app communicates with the service at each stage

→ Five grant types/flows

- Authorization code grant
- Implicit grant
- Resource owner credentials grant
- Client credentials grant
- Refresh token grant

→ We'll focus on Implicit and Authorization Code grant types/flows

### Scopes
